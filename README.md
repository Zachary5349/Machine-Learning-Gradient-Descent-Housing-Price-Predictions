# Gradient-Descent-Housing-Price-Predictions

This application can predict the price of a housing property by taking random data. The program learns to predict future prices. 

# To use

To run the program a couple packages need to be installed:


import numpy as np

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Then after you run the program, the program will take the random data and perform gradiant descent, achieving the line of best fit for the data points. 
The program will create two graphs, one is a graph of the cost function over time, and then it will graph the housign prices along with the line of best fit.
You can alter the function that generates the price of the houses if needed.
